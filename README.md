"So, this is my much more amusing checkbook application turned into a karma atm! I wanted to take my checkbook app to the next level by importing my own module and incorporating my own function. I also built a dictionary to connect karma scores to karma advice, so my function could output specific advice depending on the updated karma score balance housed in my karma_score.txt file. I hope you enjoy my spin on the project! I certainly enjoyed practicing my skills with this little program!"
